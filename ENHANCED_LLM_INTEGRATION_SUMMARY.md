Recommendations:
1. Given the bull market and recent tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf region, consider investing in Oil ETFs (USO, OIL) to capitalize on potential increases in oil prices due to geopolitical instability.
2. Monitor news related to OPEC+ countries, especially Iran and Saudi Arabia. If tensions escalate further, there could be a disruption in oil production, which may lead to price spikes.
3. Keep an eye on the US's response to any escalating tensions between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
